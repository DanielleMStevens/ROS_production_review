#### Purpose: The scripts in this repository is for processing and ploting scores of similarity for NADPH oxidase homologs. See the image below or for more details, check out this markdown file [here](process_files.md).


### Part 1: Calculate global full-length NADPH oxidase homologs 
Briefly, we wanted to cross compare the similarity of full-length NADPH oxidase homologs to the more conserved C-terminus region. This region from NADPH oxidase homologs was extracted, aligned to their respective sequence comaprsion (full length homolog vs. full length AtRBOHD and parse C-terminus of homolog vs. C-terminus of AtRBOHD), and a similarity score was calculated. Unsurprisingly, C-terminus is overall more conserved in similarity to the reference than the full-length protein.

### Part 2: Calculate similarity across residues of C-terminus AtRBOHD
While the above analysis is a simple method to show the C-terminus is more conserved than the rest of the protein, recent work has shown key S/T residues are conserved as part of their role in post-translational modification regulation. To better assess the similarity within this terminus, a scanning window approach was implimented with a 20 amino acid window to assess similarity at a positional basis.Essentially, 20mers were locally aligned to the reference and a similarity score was calculated at the reference position.
