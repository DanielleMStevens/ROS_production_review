#### Purpose: 
The scripts in this repository are for processing and ploting scores of similarity for NADPH oxidase homologs. See below or for more details, check out this markdown file [here](process_files.md). Also, package versions can be found in the session_info.txt file.

### Part 1: Calculate similarity across full-length NADPH oxidase homologs, the N-terminus, and the C-terminus
Briefly, we wanted to cross compare the similarity of full-length NADPH oxidase homologs to the N- and C-terminus region. This region from NADPH oxidase homologs was extracted via a custom blast search, aligned to their respective sequence comaprsion (full length homolog vs. full length AtRBOHD and parsed N- and C-terminus of homolog vs. N- and C-terminus of AtRBOHD, respectively), and a similarity score was calculated. Unsurprisingly, C-terminus is overall more conserved in similarity to the reference than the N-terminus and full-length protein.

### Part 2: Calculate similarity across residues of the N- and C-terminus of AtRBOHD
While the above analysis is a simple method to show the C-terminus is more conserved, recent work has shown key S/T residues are conserved as part of their role in protein regulation via post-translational modifications. To better assess the similarity within each terminus, a scanning window approach was implimented to assess similarity at a positional basis. Essentially, parsed fragments were locally aligned to the reference and a similarity score was calculated at the reference position.
